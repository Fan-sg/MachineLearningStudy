Implement the data ingestion subsystem: this is the system responsible for moving all the necessary data sources to a single location where the actual analysis will happen. This is a challenging task as all clients uses different database and data storage technologies and hence the ingestion system is always very different at different clients
Implement the data analysis pipelines. This needs close collaboration with data scientists who oversee the data analysis and modeling techniques to solve the business challenge. Once the data science problem is solved, the data engineers turn the methodology into a reliable, automated, production pipeline. This typically includes creating new processing streams in python and proprietary Lynx data processing APIs as well as reusing components from Lynx's repository of pipeline components
Integrate the results into business UIs developed by Lynx or pre-existing client software systems.

#SGUNITEDJOBS SENIOR DATA ENGINEER,Singapore,LYNX ANALYTICS PTE. LTD.,,Organic,"Reporting to the CTO, this role in an integral part of the engineering team. We are looking for a Senior Data Engineer to work on automating and productizing advanced big data transformation and analytics pipelines, and assist in developing our team of Data Engineers within Asia.
You would be working with standard big data technologies (Hadoop, Spark, etc) as well as our proprietary big graph analysis framework.
The ideal candidate would be someone with onsite B2B experience while dealing with enterprise technology deployment. They should be able to liaise with internal technology teams and work in a multi-stakeholder environment.
A Senior Data Engineer's responsibility is to implement and deploy data analysis pipelines at various clients of Lynx Analytics and also support and overlook the work of other Lynx Analytics data engineers. This includes participating in and supervising the activities below:
Understand deeply the business problem we are trying to solve by our analytical solution
Through continuous consultations with employees of our client, discover the client's existing data sources that are relevant to the problem we try to solve. This includes discussions with client IT, data owners, future business users, etc. At the end of this activity, the data engineer should have a good understanding of all relevant data sources, their schemas, semantics and physical locations and interconnections among different sources.
Working together with the IT teams of the client, define the technical architecture for the analytical solution that we are to deploy for the client. This includes figuring out which IT components will be needed, where each of them will get installed (e.g. cloud, client's own IT infrastructure), how they will connect to each other, who will be responsible for which component, etc. This also includes sizing and figuring out the necessary capacity for the various components, e.g. defining computer hardware specs and cluster sizes
Implement the data ingestion subsystem: this is the system responsible for moving all the necessary data sources to a single location where the actual analysis will happen. This is a challenging task as all clients uses different database and data storage technologies and hence the ingestion system is always very different at different clients
Implement the data analysis pipelines. This needs close collaboration with data scientists who oversee the data analysis and modeling techniques to solve the business challenge. Once the data science problem is solved, the data engineers turn the methodology into a reliable, automated, production pipeline. This typically includes creating new processing streams in python and proprietary Lynx data processing APIs as well as reusing components from Lynx's repository of pipeline components
Integrate the results into business UIs developed by Lynx or pre-existing client software systems.
Relevant tertiary qualification, preferably at Masters level or above, in Engineering or another relevant discipline with strong academic results
Experience in data engineering or data science, preferably in an analytics or machine-learning environment (or relevant organisation) and with a B2B focus
Strong programming skills, including a thorough knowledge of Python (and ideally Scala)
Good understanding of the Linux OS including basic sysadmin and shell scripting abilities
Good understanding of databases and related technologies, e.g. SQL
Strong communication skills
Some experience with managing multiple people teams in the context of a complex project
Experience in project delivery
Ability to be client-facing, with strong interpersonal skills
