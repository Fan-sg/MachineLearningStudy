And how are we growing so fast? By pioneering a new technology category with an event streaming platform, which enables companies to leverage their data as a continually updating stream of events, not as static snapshots. This innovation has led Coatue Management, Altimeter Capital and Franklin Templeton to join earlier investors Sequoia Capital, Benchmark, and Index Ventures in the recent Series E financing of a combined $250 million at a $4.5B valuation. Our product has been adopted by Fortune 100 customers across all industries, and we’re being led by the best in the space—our founders were the original creators of Apache Kafka®. We’re looking for talented and amazing team players who want to accelerate our growth, while doing some of the best work of their careers. Join us as we build the next transformative technology platform!

Consulting Engineers drive customer success by helping them realize business value from the burgeoning flow of real-time data streams in their organizations. In this role you’ll interact directly with our customers to provide software, development and operations expertise, leveraging deep knowledge of best practices in the use of Apache Kafka, the broader Confluent Platform, and complementary systems like Hadoop, Spark, Storm, relational databases, and various NoSQL databases.

Promoting Confluent and our amazing team to the community and wider public audience is something we invite all our employees to take part in. This can be in the form of writing blog posts, speaking at meetups and well known industry events about use cases and best practices, or as simple as releasing code.

Preparing for an upcoming engagement, discussing the goals and expectations with the customer and preparing an agenda
Researching best practices or components required for the engagement
Delivering an engagement on-site, working with the customer’s architects and developers in a workshop environment
Producing and delivering the post-engagement report to the customer
Developing applications on Confluent Kafka Platform
Deploy, augment, upgrade Kafka clusters
Building tooling for another team and the wider company
Testing performance and functionality of new components developed by Engineering
Writing or editing documentation and knowledge base articles
Honing your skills, building applications, or trying out new product features
Required skills and experience:
Deep experience building and operating in-production Big Data, stream processing, and/or enterprise data integration solutions using Apache Kafka

Experience with Java Virtual Machine (JVM) tuning and troubleshooting
Experience with distributed systems (Kafka, Hadoop, Cassandra, etc.)
Proficiency in Java
Excellent communication skills, with an ability to clearly and concisely explain tricky issues and complex solutions
