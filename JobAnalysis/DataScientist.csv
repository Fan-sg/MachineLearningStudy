The Government Technology Agency (GovTech) aims to transform the delivery of Government digital services by taking an ""outside-in"" view, putting citizens and businesses at the heart of everything we do. We also develop the Smart Nation infrastructure and applications, and facilitate collaboration with citizens and businesses to co-develop technologies.
Join us as we support Singapore’s vision of building a Smart Nation - a nation of possibilities empowered through info-communications technology and related engineering.

Who we are
GovTech's Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI) division uses technology and data to help deliver high-quality digital services to citizens and businesses in Singapore. We build software products for government agencies to better understand and use their data to improve operations and decision making.

What the role is
Data scientists in GovTech help crack challenging problems through the use of machine learning and other computational methods on government data. You would have the opportunity to work across domains like citizen engagement, healthcare, transport and operations.
As a data scientist, you will:
Improve public service delivery and policy by extracting insights from government data
Work closely with product managers, data scientists and engineers to develop, test and deploy new data products

The public sector is full of opportunities where even the simplest software can have a big impact on people’s lives. We are here to improve how we live as a society through what we can offer as a government.
Rapid Prototyping - Instead of spending too much time debating ideas we prefer testing them. This identifies potential problems quickly, and more importantly, conveys what is possible to others easily.
Reliable Productization - To scale an idea, a prototype or a Minimum Viable Product to a software product, we scrutinize and commit to its usability, reliability, scalability and maintainability.
Ownership - In addition to technical responsibilities, this means having ideas on how things should be done and taking responsibility for seeing them through. Building something that you believe in is the best way to build something good.
Continuous Learning - Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages is not just encouraged but essential.
What we are looking for

Assistant Research Engineer,Singapore,Singapore Management University,,Organic,"Help us build open-source tools and technologies that do for legal and qualitative reasoning what the spreadsheet has done for quantitative reasoning. At SMU's research programme in Computational Law, researchers develop open-source languages and libraries to be shared on Github and used by a future generation of web and mobile apps. We have three to five years to accomplish this goal. As a member of the team, you will have the opportunity to participate in software projects.

This involves learning foundational areas of computer science, including data structures, algorithms, programming language theory, and logic; learning how to use third party tools, including editors, IDEs, databases, business process modelling software, programming languages, specification languages; and libraries; evaluating competing software systems for suitability; building infrastructure to enable application development; managing yourself, and managing fellow team members; engaging in product, project, and program management as needed; reading books and consuming such other media forms about software development; writing documentation such as user/developer-facing manuals, tutorials; delivering community support to users and customers; preparing presentations to represent the project before external audiences; and writing user-facing applications throughout the ""full stack"". Success metrics: You can measure your (external) success in this job by the number and quality of contributions accepted into the research programme's Github repositories. Numerous software development assignments will be available. You can measure (internal) success by how frequently you find yourself in a flow state; by how many new ways of thinking you have mastered; and by how well you can get computers to help you and other people achieve important goals.

Qualifications Self-taught programmers and holders of non-CS qualifications are welcome to apply. The following qualifications are an advantage: You regularly program in at least one programming language. Programming languages include Javascript, Python, Ruby, Clojure, Reason, Scala, Scheme, Common Lisp, Haskell, Ocaml, Elm, and Prolog. You have developed at least one piece of software that somebody else has used.

You are comfortable using the Unix shell or Windows Terminal with WSL. You are able to independently learn technology from books and online courses (though you will be supported when you get stuck if you “ask questions the smart way”, as Eric Raymond and Eric Moen put it.) You have previously asked, or answered, a question on a technical community support forum. You have an account on Github or Gitlab. Other people turn to you for help with technology, and I mean people besides family.

You possess the “5 Personality Traits Every New Programmer Should Have”, according to learntocodewith.me: Patience, Courage, Passion, Creativity, Logic. You also possess the “Three Great Virtues of a Programmer”, according to threevirtues.com: Laziness, Impatience, and Hubris. Learning opportunities During your time with us, you will be exposed to areas of computing that lie beyond web/mobile app development, data science, and machine learning. You will learn to see the world as a computer scientist does – in terms of logics, languages, and libraries – and acquire, on the job, many of the skills on Matt Might’s list of “what every computer science major should know”.

Working with other junior and senior researchers, you will learn technologies and skills which will be valued across a range of future careers. You will be exposed to an on-the-job crash course in computer science that includes Unix development; languages like Javascript/Typescript, Python, and Haskell; model-driven architecture with DMN; open-source culture; and cloud computing. You will get to observe senior engineers at work and learn from them. We work with many of the technologies listed below.

In your cover letter, please list any items where you already possess some familiarity. You are welcome to add new keywords to better represent your skill set. We list these not as hard requirements but as examples of the things you will have the opportunity to learn.

"#SGUnited Software Engineer (Frontend), Artificial Intellige...",Singapore,Government Technology Agency,,Organic,"The Government Technology Agency (GovTech) aims to transform the delivery of Government digital services by taking an ""outside-in"" view, putting citizens and businesses at the heart of everything we do. We also develop the Smart Nation infrastructure and applications, and facilitate collaboration with citizens and businesses to co-develop technologies. Join us as we support Singapore’s vision of building a Smart Nation - a nation of possibilities empowered through info-communications technology and related engineering.

Who we are
GovTech's Data Science and Artificial Intelligence team uses technology and data to help deliver high-quality digital services to citizens and businesses in Singapore. We build software for government agencies to better understand and use their data to improve operations and decision making.

What the role is
As a software engineer (frontend), you will:
Work closely with product managers, UX designers, data scientists and engineers to define and develop web applications;
Use the latest web technologies to translate product specifications into fully functional interfaces;
Develop and manage well-functioning APIs;
Build and maintain extensible front-end code;
Build prototypes to demonstrate technology opportunities;
Propose how to structure front end work;
Have good eye for technical details in bridging the graphical design and technical feasibility and be sensitive to the impact of front-end implementation to the users;
Write production quality code; and
Learn and share knowledge in a multi-disciplinary team.
Additionally, more senior engineers will be expected to:

You will work on meaningful projects that solve problems pertinent to our society, from transportation, to education, to healthcare. The public sector is full of opportunities where even the simplest software can have a big impact on people’s lives. We are here to improve how we live as a society through what we can offer as a government.
Rapid Prototyping - Instead of spending too much time debating ideas we prefer testing them. This identifies potential problems quickly, and more importantly, conveys what is possible to others easily.
Ownership - In addition to technical responsibilities, this means having opinions on what is being done and having ideas on what should be done next. Building something that you believe in is the best way to build something good.
Continuous Learning - Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages is not just encouraged but essential.

What we are looking for
We look for people who:
Have a demonstrated ability to build software;
Have excellent understanding of web development and experience working with HTML5, CSS3, Node.js and modern JS frameworks (React.JS, Vue.JS, Redux etc.);

Background
Driving behaviour models are an integral part of agent-based traffic simulations which define the behaviour of vehicles on the road and thus need to represent reality as closely as possible. Models of human drivers become even more relevant nowadays in the context of mixed traffic simulation (humans interacting with autonomous vehicles). Typically, driving behaviour models (stochastic or deterministic) are constructed using domain knowledge and are thus analytical in nature. With recent advancements of machine learning techniques and specifically black-box, data-driven modelling approaches such as ANNs, the question stands whether human-driver behaviour can also be estimated well-enough by those techniques, thus surpassing the current state of the art.

Objective and tasks
The goal of this project is to evaluate and compare the descriptive potential of 1) an analytical statistical human driver model and 2) a black-box model realized using an artificial neural network. The student would be required to become familiar with the inputs and outputs of human driving behaviour models and the role they play in traffic simulations. Furthermore, the two models need to be calibrated using real life data and their performance needs to be compared. Completing the project would include the following steps:
1. Identification and preparation of the data set that will be used to create and test the models
2. Calibration of analytical statistical human driver model
3. Literature review to identify the most suitable neural network architecture and training of the model
4. Design of metrics and experiments to compare the two models
5. Results post-processing and analysis
6. Report writing

What we expect from you
Object-oriented programming concepts
C++
Statistical Modelling
Scripting
Basic understanding of discrete event simulations

What we offer you
An international and multidisciplinary working environment
Opportunity to work on a project with real-life relevance
Work with researches from world-renowned Universities

Research Fellow / Senior Research Assistant,Changi,Singapore University of Technology and Design,,Organic,"Job no: 494236
Work type: Contract, full-time
Singapore University of Technology and Design’s Meta Design Lab in collaboration with the Lee Kuan Yew Centre for Innovative Cities is calling for a Postdoctoral Fellow for a new project.
Project Description
This project aims to investigate the relationship between macro-urban configurations and its effect on the wellness of residents, focusing specifically on the elderly. It hypothesises that much of a resident’s ambient exercise and positive health aspects of a city are a product of how people navigate it on a data-to-day basis. However, the relationship between urban configurations and individual wellness has not been empirically correlated except in small scale studies or general correlations (e.g. average distance travelled against health). This research aims to take a significantly more analytical and spatially focused approach, considering and ideally correlating how an urban area effects users’ activity and decisions.
To do this it will integrate three concurrent areas of study;
1. An AI driven tracking approach to see where people go and what they do
2. An in-depth ethnographic study of resident residential activity and health
3. A design intervention into healthier residential spaces and development of design guidelines
This position focuses on supporting the first part of this and is intended to be develop a data driven approach to urban analysis, by providing insight into how people use space by using ethnical and anonymised image tracking of users of public spaces developing ML models to improve aggregate user route monitoring and identification of activity location. This will be correlated with spatial configuration of buildings, origin-destination modelling, and available route choice analysis (spatial network). Then using this empirical data as a source to do machine learning to predict space use, computing resultant health metrics, leading to automated appraisal of the wellness of the space. This work will be scaled to larger areas where possible to develop data for use in deriving more insight into user activity in tandem with the ethnographic study as data triangulation. Combing both these sources to allow for better informed developing of policy and design guidelines to improve future urban design and potentially building more user focused ML tools for urban planners.
The research is highly disciplinary but anchored in Architecture, Urban Planning and Applied A.I. and lead by, Belinda Yuen (LKYCIC), Sam Joyce (SUTD), Ngai-Man Cheung (SUTD), and Joshua Comaroff (Yale-NUS) each covering aspects of planning for wellness, applied computational design, A.I., and architectural design respectively.

Researcher Description
We are keen to take on someone who is enthusiastic about conceiving, implementing and testing technologies such as AI, ML, and computer vision to spatial problems, specifically urban analytics and design. The project is intended an investigation into the capability of ML to apply to measuring wellness and design effectiveness in the real world. It would suit someone who is more exploratory and curious about applying novel approaches. The job aims to give a motivated self-starter the research freedom and space to explore new concepts, supported and guided within a group of domain experts with strong academic and industrial backgrounds. The SUTD environment is that of a start-up university and so well suited to those with initiative both professionally and socially.
The hire will be directly report to Sam Joyce and act as part of the Meta Design Lab but will supported by Ngai-Man Cheung and his team for support in AI, ML, and image recognition aspects. They will also work closely with LKYCIC in terms of understanding wellness and health aspects and data needs for the user capture and monitoring. This project has support to capture data from government agencies and for potential wider implementation based on findings. The project will also collaborate with an industry leading company to leverage their image recognition technology-pipeline to support our activities as well as supporting potentially translational efforts if the technology is successful.
